{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"type annotations needed","code":{"code":"E0282","explanation":"The compiler could not infer a type and asked for a type annotation.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nlet x = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThis error indicates that type inference did not result in one unique possible\ntype, and extra information is required. In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nIn the example above, type `Vec` has a type parameter `T`. When calling\n`Vec::new`, barring any other later usage of the variable `x` that allows the\ncompiler to infer what type `T` is, the compiler needs to be told what it is.\n\nThe type can be specified on the variable:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThe type can also be specified in the path of the expression:\n\n```\nlet x = Vec::<i32>::new();\n```\n\nIn cases with more complex types, it is not necessary to annotate the full\ntype. Once the ambiguity is resolved, the compiler can infer the rest:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<_> = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect();\n```\n\nAnother way to provide the compiler with enough information, is to specify the\ngeneric type parameter:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<char>>();\n```\n\nAgain, you need not specify the full type if the compiler can infer it:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n```\n\nApart from a method or function with a generic type parameter, this error can\noccur when a type parameter of a struct or trait cannot be inferred. In that\ncase it is not always possible to use a type annotation, because all candidates\nhave the same return type. For instance:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nstruct Foo<T> {\n    num: T,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Foo<T> {\n    fn bar() -> i32 {\n        0\n    }\n\n    fn baz() {\n        let number = Foo::bar();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will fail because the compiler does not know which instance of `Foo` to\ncall `bar` on. Change `Foo::bar()` to `Foo::<T>::bar()` to resolve the error.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"main.rs","byte_start":5996,"byte_end":6004,"line_start":166,"line_end":166,"column_start":20,"column_end":28,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        let func = instance.get_func(&mut store, &func_name).context(\"Export not found\")?;","highlight_start":20,"highlight_end":28}],"label":"type must be known at this point","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"main.rs","byte_start":5857,"byte_end":5865,"line_start":163,"line_end":163,"column_start":9,"column_end":17,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    let instance = linker.instantiate_async(&mut store, &module).await?;","highlight_start":9,"highlight_end":17}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"consider giving `instance` an explicit type","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"main.rs","byte_start":5865,"byte_end":5865,"line_start":163,"line_end":163,"column_start":17,"column_end":17,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    let instance = linker.instantiate_async(&mut store, &module).await?;","highlight_start":17,"highlight_end":17}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":": /* Type */","suggestion_applicability":"HasPlaceholders","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0282]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[97m: type annotations needed\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[96m--> \u001b[0mmain.rs:163:9\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96m163\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m     let instance = linker.instantiate_async(&mut store, &module).await?;\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m         \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96m...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96m166\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m         let func = instance.get_func(&mut store, &func_name).context(\"Export not found\")?;\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m                    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m--------\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96mtype must be known at this point\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: consider giving `instance` an explicit type\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96m163\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m| \u001b[0m    let instance\u001b[92m: /* Type */\u001b[0m = linker.instantiate_async(&mut store, &module).await?;\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m                 \u001b[92m++++++++++++\u001b[0m\n\n"}
